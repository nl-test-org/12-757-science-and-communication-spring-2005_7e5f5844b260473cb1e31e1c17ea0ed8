What constitutes 'scientific publication'?{{< br >}}*   How much should we publish and when is a research project at the right stage for publication?{{< br >}}*   How is a paper judged by referees and editors? What constitutes a conflict of interest and what should you do if you have one?{{< br >}}*   What makes a good scientific paper? What are your favorite scientific papers, and most of all, why? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |

In what ways might the content of a seminar be different from that of a scientific paper?{{< br >}}*   How do you plan and prepare for a seminar?{{< br >}}*   What qualities make for a good seminar? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  |
| 13-16 | The Practice of Scientific Communication |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} In the remainder of the semester the participants will have a chance to give a short oral report of their thesis research (or of a paper they find interesting) to a critical but sympathetic audience, their classmates. Each class member will give the presenter a written evaluation. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Our goal in these short seminars is to emphasize the beginning and the end parts of the research story, while largely omitting the technical details of the middle (which are, of course, crucially important but you deal with that at length elsewhere). This seminar will have been successful if the participants find that they are even slightly more comfortable writing and talking about the goals, the logical structure and the interpretation of their research. Are the goals, as you write them down now, any different than at the time of the first class, Question 1(a)? {{< br >}}{{< br >}}
